# Portfolio API
This is the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) API for portfolio-app.
This is a work in progress, the objective is to have an editable frontend without needing to redeploy it.
In the 1.0 version only the static (portfolio-app) frontend will be available.

The API will also use Express as a server but that may yet change.


## Requirements
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) (Tested with node@22.10.0)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (docker@27.2.0+) 

## Installation

```sh
npm i
node server.js
```
